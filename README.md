# NCDMortality

# This repository represents the culmination of the semester project for Tulane's Data Analysis course (MATH-7360) by Delia Carlino and Kyra Zhu. 

# In this project we used the World Health Organization's noncommunicable disease mortality database to examine trends involving sex, time, and different regions. The main objectives of our project were to visualize these trends, perform a regression analysis to examine correlation, and show a world map of mortality rates.
